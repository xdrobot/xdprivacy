        <p>This privacy statement applies to websites, services, products and applications that collect data and display these terms. It does not apply to other Microsoft products and services that do not link to this Privacy Statement.</p>
        <h2>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>Most Microsoft sites and services use &quot;cookies&quot;, small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; to combat fraud; and analyze site operations.</p>
        <p>We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser controls to block and delete cookies;</li>
            <li>Operating system controls to influence Advertising Ids and other similar services;</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Microsoft collects many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can.</p>
        <p>We collect information when you register, sign in and use our sites and services. We may collect other information, such as your location, information from your calendar, the apps you use, information from your emails and text messages, and your contacts. There are generally features available within your operating system that allow you to control whether this information is made available to applications and services.</p>
        <p>We also may get information from other companies.</p>
        <p>We collect this information in a variety of ways, including from web forms, technologies like cookies, web logging and software on your computer or other device.</p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer. We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account and security updates.</p>
        <p>We use the information we collect to maintain and improve the quality, security and integrity of our services. For example we may use this information for research purposes and to improve the accuracy of services we are providing. This information is also necessary in order to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, worms, and other threats.</p>
        <p>We may use some of the information collected by this service for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners.
        </p>
        <p>Most of the online advertisements on Microsoft sites and services are displayed by Microsoft Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more cookies in order to recognize your computer when we display an ad to you. Over time, we may gather information from the sites where we serve ads and use the information to help provide more relevant ads.</p>
        <p><strong>You may opt out of receiving targeted ads
    from Microsoft Advertising by visiting our </strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"><b>Your privacy and
    Microsoft personalized ads</b></a>. For more information about how Microsoft Advertising collects and uses information, please see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248689">Microsoft
    Advertising Privacy Statement. </a>
        </p>
        <h2>Reasons We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Except as described in this privacy statement, we won’t disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent.</p>
        <p>Please see Other Important Privacy Information below for additional details about when we may disclose information, including with Microsoft affiliates and vendors; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to combat fraud or protect our interest; or to protect lives.</p>
        <h2>Location Based Services</h2>
        <p>Certain services or features can use information about your location to provide services you request or personalize your experience. Location information may include data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, as wells as Global Position System (GPS) data.</p>
        <p>Certain services may allow you to control when location information is sent to Microsoft or made available to others. In some cases, location information is essential to the service and may require uninstalling the feature or discontinuing the service to stop the sending of location information. Refer to the documentation that came with your device for information about how to turn off location features.
        </p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>When a Microsoft site or service collects age information, it will block users under 13 or obtain consent from a parent or guardian before their child can use it.</p>
        <p>When consent is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account, including being able to communicate with other users.</p>
        <h2>Communication Preferences</h2>
        <p>You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from Microsoft sites and services by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. You also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls and postal mail from Microsoft by visiting and signing in to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243191">Promotional Communications
    Manager</a>.</p>
        <h2>Microsoft account</h2>
        <p>Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. We also send certain information to a site or service you have signed into with your Microsoft account.</p>
        <p>To view additional details about Microsoft account, including how to create and use a Microsoft account, how to edit account information, and how we collect and use information relating to a Microsoft account, see below.</p>
        <p>Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. This includes products, websites and services such as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248607">Xbox Live</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248592">Microsoft
      Hotmail</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248590">Microsoft
      Office 2013</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248590">Windows
      Phone</a>; and</li>
            <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248590">Windows 8</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creating a Microsoft account</h3>
        <p>You can create a Microsoft account <a href="https://signup.live.com/">here</a> by providing an email address, a password and other &quot;account proofs&quot;, such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your &quot;account proofs&quot; for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your &quot;credentials&quot; that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.</p>
        <p>When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting <a href="http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/">this page</a> so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/AdDisplay.mspx">Microsoft
    Advertising Privacy Supplement</a>.</p>
        <p>You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.</p>
        <p>Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please refer to the Communications section.</p>
        <p>If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.</p>
        <h3>Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account. </h3>
        <p>When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.</p>
        <p>Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.</p>
        <p>If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the <a href="http://explore.live.com/microsoft-service-agreement?ref=none">Microsoft Service Agreement</a> and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.</p>
        <p>Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary. <i>You
    should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign into in
    order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.</i>
        </p>
        <h3>Accessing your personal information.</h3>
        <p>You can access your personal information by going to <a href="https://account.live.com/">account</a>. You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain. You can always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer. You may also close your Microsoft account by going to <a href="https://account.live.com/">account</a>, and then &quot;Close your account.&quot; If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account. Please note that if you are an MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.</p>
        <p>More information about Microsoft account is available at the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=98604">Microsoft
    account web site</a>.</p>

Much of this describes common practices that we want you to know about but don’t think it’s necessary to highlight in every one of our privacy statements.

        <p>Please note that our sites and online services may contain advertising, content, or other functionality provided by other companies that may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. Our sites and services may also include links to the sites or services of other companies. Information collected by those companies will be governed by the privacy statements of those companies. We encourage you to review the privacy statement of any site or service you use.</p>
        <h3>Protecting the Security of Personal Information </h3>
        <p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
        <p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share it. If you are sharing a computer, you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>
        <h3>Where Information is Stored and Processed </h3>
        <p>Personal information collected on Microsoft sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

        <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Statements </h3>
